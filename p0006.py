"""Problem 6: Sum square differenceThe sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first tennatural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first onehundred natural numbers and the square of the sum."""def sum_squares_first(quantities):    list_number = []    for quantity in range(quantities+1):        list_number.append(quantity**2)    return sum(list_number)def square_sum_first(quantities):    return sum(range(quantities+1))**2def difference_square_of_sum(quantities):    sq_s_f = square_sum_first(quantities)    su_s_f = sum_squares_first(quantities)    dif = sq_s_f - su_s_f    print('La suma de los cuadrados es ', su_s_f)    print('El cuadrado de la suma es ', sq_s_f)    print('La diferecia entre {} y {} es de {}'.format(sq_s_f, su_s_f, dif))natural_numbers = 100difference_square_of_sum(natural_numbers)
